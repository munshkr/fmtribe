## Usage ##

* `Esc`: Exit
* `F5`: Play / pause
* `F7`: Stop after bar (2 times, stop immeadiately)
* `F9`: Tap tempo
* `Shift` + `F9`: Toggle metronome
* `Shift` + `F10`: Toggle "follow cursor"
* `Left`: Move to previous frame
* `Right`: Move to next frame
* `<`: Move left in the channel selector
* `>`: Move right in the channel selector
* `Del`: Clear pattern for current channel
* `Ctrl` + `Del`: Clear pattern for all channels
* `Tab`: Switch instrument editor for the current channel

### Step Sequencer ###

To toggle a step in the pattern of the 16-step sequencer, use the keys:

    Q W E R T Y U I
    A S D F G H J K

To select one of the eight channels, use keys 1 through 8.

### Instrument Editor ###

To customize the parameters of an instrument, press the Tab key, select a field
and change its value. The parameters will update automatically if the step
sequencer is playing.

* `Left`/`Right`: Increase/decrease value for the current field
* `Up`/`Down`: Move between parameter fields

Also, you can still change channels with the numbers from the instrument
editor.

To change the base note of the instrument, use the keys:

      W   E       T   Y   U
    A   S   D   F   G   H   J

as in a keyboard of one octave. To change the base octave, use `PageUp`/`PageDown`.

## Installation ##

As this is currently in an *alpha* stage, there are no binaries to download.
You must download the DJGPP compiler and some of its tools.  *todo*
